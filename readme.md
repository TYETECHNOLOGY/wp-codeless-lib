# Codeless Library
An helper library with functionalities that are common among my WP projects so that I don’t have to write the same things many times.

## Features
The codeless library includes:

- 2 functions to check if WP_DEBUG and SCRIPT_DEBUG are defined.
- utility class to display admin notices with ability to dismiss notices via ajax.
- utility function to add plugin action links.
- utility function to add plugin row meta links.
- utility function to add a plugin message ( similar to the update message into the plugin’s page ).
- count bubble
- helper function to add admin menu bar items
- add columns to the user’s table.
- add columns to post types tables.
- add columns to taxonomies tables.
- add new action links to post rows.
- a jQuery modal interface that replicates the look and feel of WP’s media manager modals.
